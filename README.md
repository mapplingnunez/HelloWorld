# HelloWorld
This repository will be used as I transition out of a career in education and into a career in technology storing my GitHub practice as well as a way to identify if I would be a good fit for your team. 

I am a highly motivated individual with over 15 years of experience fostering stakeholders understanding of complex tasks. My greatest strength is communication, and I have a talent for analysis and problem-solving. I am passionate safeguarding organizations and people through confidentiality, integrity, and availability of assests. Beyond that I am excited to learn new things, and I value independence, creativity, and loyalty.
