# HelloWorld
This repository will be used as I transition out of education and into a career in technology storing my GitHub practice as well as a way to identify if I would be a good fit for your team. 
I am an educator with over 15 years of experience fostering stakeholders understanding of complex tasks. My greatest strength is communication, and I have a talent for analysis and problem-solving. I am passionate about my friends and family, and I value independence, creativity, and loyalty.
