#Controls and Compliance Assessment

##Case Study

The following is based on a ficticious company: 

Botium Toys: Scope, goals, and risk assessment report

Summary: Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location, which serves as their main office, a storefront, and warehouse for their products. However, Botium Toy’s online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. As a result, their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 

The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. She's worried about maintaining compliance and business operations as the company grows without a clear plan. She believes an internal audit can help better secure the company’s infrastructure and help them identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, or vulnerabilities to critical assets. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to internally processing and accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).

Your task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report. Then, perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
Scope and goals of the audit
Scope: The scope of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes all company assets are to be assessed alongside current internal processes and procedures as related to the implementation of industry controls and compliance like the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). 
Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices that need to be implemented to  improve Botium Toys’ security posture.
Current assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
On-premises equipment for in-office business needs  
Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse
Management of systems, software, and services: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
Internet access
Internal network
Data retention and storage
Legacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring 
Risk assessment
Risk description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 
Control best practices
The first of the five functions of the NIST CSF is Identify. Botium Toys will need to dedicate resources to identify assets so they can appropriately manage them. Additionally, they will need to classify existing assets and determine the impact of the loss of existing assets, including systems, on business continuity.
Risk score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is 8, which is fairly high. This is due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.
Additional comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is high because Botium Toys does not have all of the necessary controls in place and is not fully adhering to best practices related to compliance regulations that keep critical data private/secure. Review the following bullet points for specific details:

Additional Information
Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

Administrative/Managerial controls
Technical controls
Physical/Operational controls

Control types, providing defense and  include, but are not limited to:	
Preventative
Corrective
Detective
Deterrent
Control Assessment Checklist: 
Administrative/Managerial Controls
Yes/No/Other
Control
Explaination(s)
Implementation Priority
No
Least Privilege
Preventative; Currently, all Botium Toys employees have access to internally stored data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers’ PII/SPII. Updating this control will reduce the overall risk of a potential breach.
High
No
Disaster recovery plans
Corrective; Presently Botium Toys does not have a disaster recovery plan in place. Impleting a recovery plan will ensure the organization maintains continuity.
High
Other
Password policies/Password management system
Preventative; Currently, Botium has a password policy in place; however, it is inadequate and poses significant security risks. Strengthening the organization’s password authentication rules will enhance its overall security posture. This includes implementing requirements for password complexity, expiration, and lifecycle monitoring to mitigate vulnerabilities. Additionally, implementing a robust password policy supports better management of account lifecycles. This reduces the organization's attack surface, limits risks associated with default account usage, and mitigates potential damage caused by disgruntled former employees. Furthermore, Botium lacks a centralized password management system to enforce minimum password requirements. This gap can lead to inefficiencies, as employees and vendors frequently rely on the IT department for password recovery or resets. Implementing a centralized system would not only improve compliance with security policies but also boost productivity by streamlining password-related processes.
High/Medium
No
Separation of duties
Preventative; Currently separation of duties have not been implemented (all employees have access to locally stored data, specifically customers data PII and PSII) limiting accountability. As a result, this vulnerability can be exploited. Establishing clear duties will mitigate the impact of potential known risks. 
High



Technical Controls
Yes/No/Other
Control
Explaination(s)
Implementation Priority
Yes
Firewall
Preventative; Botium Toys’ IT department has a firewall that blocks traffic based on an appropriately defined set of security rules.
X
No
Intrusion detection system (IDS)
Detective; IDS detects and prevents anomalous traffic that matches a signature or rule. The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS) exposing Botium Toys to potential interal and external threat actors. Having an IDS in place would help the IT Team identify possible breaches from threat actors. 
High
No
Backups
Corrective; Presently Botium Toys does not have a backup plan in place. Impleting incremental/partial/full backup plans will ensure the organization’s ability to restore/recover critical data maintaining continuity.
High
Yes
Antivirus software
Preventative; Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department. 
X
Other
Manual monitoring, maintenance, and intervention
Preventative: While legacy systems are monitored and maintained, there is no regular schedule in place for these tasks and intervention methods are unclear. These are necessary to identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities to out-of-date systems
High/Medium
No
Encryption
Deterrent; Encryption provides confidentiality to sensitive data and is not currently used, by Botium Toys, to ensure confidentiality of customers’ credit card information that is accepted, processed, transmitted, and stored locally in the company’s internal database. This violate laws and regulations.
